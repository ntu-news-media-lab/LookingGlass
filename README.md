## Features

- Curated Contents: News editorial team can curate content depend on their needs and readers' interest
- Multiple perspectives and content format on the issue
    1. **main article** feature
    2. **past coverage** on the related issue covered by the same news organisation (only pertaining for our anchored news organisation)
    3. **twitter embedding** to enhance the timeliness of the issue and allow further topic engagement to social media
    4. **global coverage** (optional) to search for related coverage by other news organisation
    5. **Video coverage** to provide a different media to interact with the content or topic featured

# 4. Future Iterations

We hope to improve the product through further iterations:

- **Selective global coverage**

    Currently the global coverage is done through google news search without any content filtering from a particular news organisation. It would be good if we can display only desired news partners' content

- **History of Roundup**

    To enable an archive function for readers to refer to past LookingGlass page of the same news oragnisation

- Bookmark and Sharing of Looking Glass link

    The ability to allow the readers to easily bookmark the page url and share the link via social media networking is crucial to promote the tool and acquire more readers.
